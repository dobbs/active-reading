# Active Reading

Exploring current browser affordances for use in local-first software
development informed by experience collaborating in federated wiki.

Experiment in making software a good team player that serves the
reader. What will we discover when the software reveals how it is
modeling the reader. I believe a reader will more easily diagnose and
adapt to surprising behavior from the software when they can see for
themselves where the software has misunderstood or where it is
misrepresenting them.
